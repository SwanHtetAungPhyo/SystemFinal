**Credit Risk Modeling Proposal**  
Implementing a machine learning (ML)-based credit risk system will enhance Citi’s loan management by automating risk assessment, reducing defaults, and enabling data-driven decisions. This system will improve accuracy over traditional methods, optimize interest rates, and ensure compliance with regulatory standards.

### **Data Requirements**  
**Input Variables:**  
- **Customer Data**:  
  - Credit score, age, employment status, income, debt-to-income (DTI) ratio.  
  - Payment history, existing liabilities, collateral value.  
- **Loan Details**:  
  - Loan amount, term, purpose (e.g., mortgage, personal).  
- **Macroeconomic Indicators**:  
  - Unemployment rate, inflation, interest rates.  
- **Behavioral Data**:  
  - Transaction patterns, savings habits.  
- **External Data**:  
  - Credit bureau reports (e.g., Experian), public records (bankruptcies).  

**Data Sources**:  
- Internal databases (application forms, transaction history).  
- External APIs (credit bureaus, economic datasets).

### **Data Outputs**  
- **Risk Probability Score**:  
  - Probability of default (e.g., 0–100%).  
- **Risk Classification**:  
  - Labels: *Low Risk*, *Medium Risk*, *High Risk*.  
- **Recommended Actions**:  
  - Loan approval/rejection, adjusted interest rates, collateral requirements.  
- **Explainability Reports**:  
  - SHAP values or LIME outputs to justify decisions (critical for regulatory compliance).

### **Architecture**  
**Model Selection**:  
- **Gradient Boosting Machines (XGBoost/LightGBM)**:  
  - Handles non-linear relationships, robust to missing data.  
  - Provides feature importance scores.  
- **Hybrid Approach**:  
  - Combine ML with logistic regression for interpretability.  
- **Deep Learning (Optional)**:  
  - Neural networks for unstructured data (e.g., text-based employment history).  

**Pipeline**:  
1. **Data Ingestion**: Batch/real-time data collection.  
2. **Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, normalize features.  
3. **Feature Engineering**: Derive metrics like DTI, payment consistency.  
4. **Model Training**: Cross-validation to prevent overfitting.  
5. **API Deployment**: Integrate with Citi’s loan management system for real-time scoring.  
6. **Monitoring**: Track accuracy, fairness, and drift over time.  

**Tech Stack**:  
- Python (scikit-learn, XGBoost), TensorFlow/Keras (for DL).  
- AWS/GCP for scalable compute.  
- Airflow for pipeline orchestration.

### **Risks and Challenges**  
1. **Data Quality**: Missing/inaccurate historical data may skew predictions.  
2. **Bias & Fairness**: Models might inherit biases from past discriminatory practices.  
   - Mitigation: Regular fairness audits, bias-correction algorithms.  
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: GDPR, ECOA, and “right to explanation” requirements.  
4. **Model Drift**: Economic shifts (e.g., recessions) degrade performance.  
   - Mitigation: Retrain models quarterly with updated data.  
5. **Interpretability**: Balancing accuracy with explainability for regulators and customers.  
6. **Integration Costs**: Compatibility with legacy systems.

### **Conclusion**  
This proposal outlines a scalable, compliant credit risk system that leverages ML to minimize defaults while maintaining transparency. Next steps include a pilot program with historical data validation and stakeholder training.  

**Estimated Impact**:  
- 20–30% reduction in default rates.  
- 15% faster loan approval turnaround.  
- Improved customer trust through explainable decisions.
